I am a computational marine biologist with a focus on genetics and molecular biology, and it is through this lens that I approach research questions regarding the biodiversity of marine organisms in the wake of our changing climate. I am currently finishing up my Marine Biology PhD at the [University of Maine](https://https://umaine.edu/) based out of [Bigelow Laboratory for Ocean Sciences](https://www.bigelow.org//) and co-advised by [Doug Rasher](https://www.bigelow.org/about/people/drasher.html) and [Damian Brady](https://umaine.edu/marine/people/damian-c-brady/). 

I am interested in the effects that climate change has on our ecosystem, how organisms adapt to this change, and what this means for our future. I have extensive training in molecular biology and bioinformatics, and enjoy applying these skills to our marine environment. For my PhD, I am studying the kelp forests of the Gulf of Maine, using field work, molecular lab work, and bioinformatics. Two main goals of my research are to describe the population genetics of two predominant kelp species that are present along our coast, as well as determine and forecast the presence of an invasive, harmful bryozoan species that colonizes on the fronds of kelp.

I worked as a research assistant at [Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution](https://www.whoi.edu/) for three years. While there, I worked in two labs - John Stegeman/Jed Goldstone's Environmental Toxicology Lab as well as Annette Govindarajan's Molecular Ecology Lab as part of the [Ocean Twilight Zone](https://twilightzone.whoi.edu/) project.

I earned my M.S. in Computational Biology as well as my B.S. in Biological Sciences at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/). I was a member of Veronica Hinman's [Evolution, Development, and Regeneration Lab](https://labs.bio.cmu.edu/hinman/), and successfully defended my thesis in 2016.

Before any formal higher education, I fell in love with the ocean, the salt marsh, and marine organisms as a young kid. That excitement and awe grew into a passion while volunteering at Massachusetts Audubon Society's [Wellfleet Bay Wildlife Sanctuary](https://www.massaudubon.org/get-outdoors/wildlife-sanctuaries/wellfleet-bay). It was this experience - conducting juvenile horseshoe crab studies, oyster reef restoration studies, and monitoring diamondback terrapin nests - that made me realize I wanted to study our natural environmental for the rest of my life.
