I am currently a first year Marine Biology PhD student at the [University of Maine](https://https://umaine.edu/), based out of [Bigelow Laboratory for Ocean Sciences](https://www.bigelow.org//). I am part of the Maine EPSCoR project [Maine-eDNA](https://umaine.edu/edna/), co-advised by [Doug Rasher](https://www.bigelow.org/about/people/drasher.html) and [Damian Brady](https://umaine.edu/marine/people/damian-c-brady/).

I'm interested in the effects that climate change has on our ecosystem, how populations of organisms adapt to this change, and what this means for our future. I currently study the kelp forests of the Gulf of Maine, using field work, molecular lab work, and bioinformatics to learn about how these foundational species are responding to our changing climate.
