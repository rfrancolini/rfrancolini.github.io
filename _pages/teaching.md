I have always enjoyed teaching others about the natural history of the earth. Below are some selected teaching experiences and outreach events I have been a part of through the years. If you are interested in collaborating on an education-focused project, please feel free to contact me.

In 2017 and 2018, I hosted the 3rd grade class of the East Falmouth Elementary School for their field trip to Woods Hole. They had learned about pollution in their science class that year, so we brought those lessons to life with some hands-on activities. At that point in time, I was a research assistant for John Stegeman and Jed Goldstone working on the response of zebrafish to environmental toxins. There were 4 main components to the field trip: 

**(1) A tour of the zebrafish facility:** where they saw juvenile and adult zebrafish, learned how we cared for the the fish, and discussed the importance of upkeep of your research organisms. 

**(2) A tour of our miscroscope facility:** where we talked about the basics of microscope use, and they saw embryonic zebrafish in different stages of development.

**(3) DNA extraction lab:** this is where we connected the concept of pollution that they were familiar with to the idea that pollutants can also be invisible, just like the effect of toxins on zebrafish. We discussed what DNA is, and how studying DNA can inform us how an animal may respond to toxins in the environment. The first step in analyzing DNA is to extract it from the animal (or living thing) of interest. We therefore jumped to an activity they could all participate in: extracting DNA from strawberries!! Extracting DNA from strawberries can be done in a very safe manner, with materials you can find at home, and results in a super fun glob of DNA that resembles snot... perfect for 3rd graders!

**(4) Pollution Clean-up at the Beach:** we wrapped the day up with a trip to the beach across the street, where we enjoyed the sand and all cleaned up visible pieces of garbage.
