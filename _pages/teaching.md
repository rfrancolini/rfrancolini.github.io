I have always enjoyed teaching others about the natural history of the earth. Below are some selected teaching experiences and outreach events I have been a part of through the years. If you are interested in collaborating on an education-focused project, please feel free to contact me.

In 2017 and 2018, I hosted the 3rd grade class of the East Falmouth Elementary School for their field trip to Woods Hole. They had learned about pollution in their science class that year, so we brought those lessons to life with some hands-on activities. At that point in time, I was a research assistant for John Stegeman and Jed Goldstone working on the response of zebrafish to environmental toxins. There were 4 main components to the field trip: 

***(1) A tour of the zebrafish facility:*** where they saw juvenile and adult zebrafish, learned how we cared for the the fish, and discussed the importance of upkeep of your research organisms. 

***(2) A tour of our miscroscope facility:*** where we talked about the basics of microscope use, and they saw embryonic zebrafish in different stages of development.

***(3) DNA extraction lab:*** this is where we connected the concept of pollution that they were familiar with to the idea that pollutants can also be invisible, just like the effect of toxins on zebrafish. We discussed what DNA is, and how studying DNA can inform us how an animal may respond to toxins in the environment. The first step in analyzing DNA is to extract it from the animal (or living thing) of interest. We therefore jumped to an activity they could all participate in: extracting DNA from strawberries!! Extracting DNA from strawberries can be done in a very safe manner, with materials you can find at home, and results in a super fun glob of DNA that resembles snot... perfect for 3rd graders!

***(4) Pollution Clean-up at the Beach:*** we wrapped the day up with a trip to the beach across the street, where we enjoyed the sand and all cleaned up visible pieces of garbage.

## Woods Hole Science Stroll

For two years, I volunteered at the Woods Hole Science Stroll. This is a one day event where organizations, institutions, and research laboratories in Woods Hole host a fair with touch tanks, educational booths, scientific crafts, and tours of the vessels currently at the dock. In 2017, I participated as a part of the environmental toxicology lab group. We hosted a booth about zebrafish, teaching the public about the scientific uses of this model organism, and had live organsims so they could learn the differences between males and females, AB lines versus TL lines, and what a zebrafish may look like at different life stages. In 2018, I spent the day giving tours of WHOI's vessel Atlantis, describing what a day in the life of a scientist on a research cruise is like, what needs to be considered when preparing for a research cruise, and the important features of each lab space.

## Hawai‘i Institute of Marine Biology: Research Experiences in Marine Science

![REMS.](/images/REMSGroup-labeled.jpg)

In 2014, I spent the summer as a teaching assistant for Research Experiences in Marine Science (REMS) program, hosted at Hawai‘i Institute of Marine Biology. This program is a 5 week intensive for high school students attending Hawai‘i Public Title I schools with native Hawaiian, Filipino, and other Pacific Islander backgrounds with the goal to increase interest in marine science fields. For the first two weeks, lessons were focused on marine conservation, sustainability, and scientific methods, with the aim of applying this to tropical systems. In the last three weeks, the students worked on group research projects, generating their own questions, designing and carrying out their experiments, and synthesizing a scientific report. At the end of the course, they presented their work to an audience of previous guest lecturers, family members, funders, and Hawai‘i state senators. Projects included investigating the effects of sunlight on the zooxanthellae of upside-down jellyfish, the regeneration of snapping shrimp claws, and the diversity of corals along the reefs of Kāne‘ohe Bay.

## Wellfleet Bay Wildlife Sanctuary Natural History Day Camp

From 2011 through 2013, I was a day camp instructor at Massachusetts Audubon Society's Wellfleet Bay Wildlife Sanctuary's Natural History Day Camp. I taught campers from ages 4 through 14 about the natural history of Cape Cod and environmental stewardship through science labs, hands-on activities, games, and arts and crafts projects. Each week of camp had a different theme, such as "Dig it!", "Metamorphosis Madness!", or "Crazy Critters!". Examples of activities include squid dissections, metamorphosis kickball, owl pellet dissections, designing birdfeeders, and lessons on animal adaptations, such as how seals stay warm in cold waters and why some birds have different shaped bills than others. All lessons were paired with outdoor walks and exploration at one of the five ecosystems located on the sanctuary - the swamp, the pond, the forest, the marsh, or the tidal flats. During this time, I was also the Naturalist-In-Training coordinator, organizing our high school volunteers, pairing them with classrooms for the week, and offering trainings to improve on their educational skills. 

Alongside day camp, I also led public program tours, including "The Big Seine" and "Seashore Ramble". These were 2-3 hour programs offered for families visiting the sanctuary, which included a guided walk through the sanctuary's ecosystems and time to explore the tidal flats with dip and seine nets.
