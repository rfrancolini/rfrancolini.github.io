## Gulf of Maine Kelp Forests

My Ph.D. research focuses on the kelp forests that line to coast of Maine. The forests are primarily made of two species - Oarweed (*Laminaria digitata*) and Sugar Kelp (*Saccharina latissima*). These foundation species create habitat, provide shelter, and are a food resource for other Gulf of Maine organisms. Alongside their ecological importance, these species have aquaculture value, as they rely on seed from wild kelp forests to generate their crop. Currently, sugar kelp is farmed in the Gulf of Maine, and oarweed has the potential to be a farmed in the future.

However, climate change is threatening the survival of these species. The Gulf of Maine is warming at an unprecedented rate, and the ability for these kelps to withstand higher temperatures is currently unknown. This question of thermal tolerance is one that I aim to answer through my research. Another gap in our knowledge is how genetically related each of the populations are along the coast - known as population connectivity. Understanding how connected pockets of these species are will allow us to make scientifically sound aquaculture decisions when it comes to harvesting and seeding our wild kelp beds while maintaining the natural diversity at the same time. A final part of my research is using field data to model the future of our forests - not only of the kelps, but also of the critters that rely on the kelps - as they will most likely change as the kelp forests adapt to the current and future state of our ocean.
