I am a computational marine ecologist with a focus on genetics and molecular biology, and it is through this lens that I approach research questions regarding the biodiversity of marine organisms in the wake of our changing climate. I completed my Ph.D. in Marine Biology at the [University of Maine](https://https://umaine.edu/) while working at [Bigelow Laboratory for Ocean Sciences](https://www.bigelow.org//), co-advised by [Dr. Douglas Rasher](https://www.bigelow.org/about/people/drasher.html) and [Dr. Damian Brady](https://umaine.edu/marine/people/damian-c-brady/) in September 2025. My doctoral research investigated the population genomics of kelp forests along the coast of Maine in the face of both climate change as well as a growing aquaculture industry in Maine. In addition, I used molecular genetics and computational modeling to observe the presence of invasive species which are harmful to the kelp forests, and generated multi-variate statistical models that project the presence of said species into the future.

I have a strong technical foundation in biological sciences and computational biology, which I earned my B.S. and M.S. degrees in, respectively, from Carnegie Mellon University. It is through this technical and computational lens that I approach questions regarding the current status and future state of the biodiversity of our marine ecosystems. 

As an educator, I focus on ensuring my students learn how to critically think about their scientific questions while simultaneously building upon their computational skills and passion for marine sciences. I aim to create an equitable learning environment where students feel that they all have access to resources that encourage them to succeed. My own lived experiences as a queer woman in STEM have helped me pursue this goal from an institutional level down to daily interpersonal interactions.

Before any formal higher education, I fell in love with the ocean, the salt marsh, and marine organisms as a young kid. That excitement and awe grew into a passion while volunteering at Massachusetts Audubon Society's [Wellfleet Bay Wildlife Sanctuary](https://www.massaudubon.org/get-outdoors/wildlife-sanctuaries/wellfleet-bay). It was this experience - conducting juvenile horseshoe crab studies, oyster reef restoration studies, and monitoring diamondback terrapin nests - that made me realize I wanted to study our natural environmental for the rest of my life.
