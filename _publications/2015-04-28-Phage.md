title: "Whole genome comparison of a large collection of
mycobacteriophages reveals a continuum of phage genetic diversity"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2015-04-28-Phage
excerpt: 'The bacteriophage population is large, dynamic, ancient, and genetically diverse. Limited genomic information shows that phage genomes are mosaic, and the genetic architecture of phage populations remains ill-defined. To understand the population structure of phages infecting a single host strain, we isolated, sequenced, and compared 627 phages of <i>Mycobacterium smegmatis</i>.'

The bacteriophage population is large, dynamic, ancient, and genetically diverse. Limited genomic information shows that phage genomes are mosaic, and the genetic architecture of phage populations remains ill-defined. To understand the population structure of phages infecting a single host strain, we isolated, sequenced, and compared 627 phages of *Mycobacterium smegmatis*.
